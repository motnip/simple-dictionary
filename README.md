This is a simple Golang project I used to play around with Go.
The project aims to be an online dictionary. There is a set of RestFul APIs to:
- add a new dictionary with a name
- add a word to the given dictionary
- list all the words in that dictionary
- 
That is a "live" project; it is continuously under development. I'll add other API and features.

Good learning
